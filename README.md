Hi! Eduard here.

I am:

Currently learning cryptocurrency source codes of ethereum and bitcoin,cryptography, and algorithm designs. Planning to launch a coin of my own soon. Working on the white paper now. 
A Python developer. Also Solidity and Javascript.
Had an affinity for AI and data science. 
A bit of a cyberpunk/cypherpunk in terms of a futuristic hope & city aesthetics and belief that everyone deserves a decentrialized cyberspace and rights to privacy (data rights).
A fan of the video game Watch Dogs.
Witty.
Becoming more and more Aspergers as I learn coding.
Someone who likes direct and to-the-point communication.

That's all for today! Hoping to collaborate with you soon!

Best,
Eduard
